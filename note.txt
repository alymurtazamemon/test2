When we should use --dev to install a package?
=> We use --dev when we work as a developer, then we use that package as devdependency, GitHub repos were not made to build a website, this is used to manage the
backend. The tools we use as devdependency are used to make our life eassier.
When we install package for our website we don't use --dev. 

useMoralis() = it is a react hook which allows us to hook into react state and lifecycle features.

we need to add MoralisProvider into app.js. import {MoralisProvider} from "react-moralis"

<button onClick={async () => {await enableWeb3()}}>Connect</button>        with this line of code we can connect with metamask

Hooks are really good to rerendering our website when some value is changed

{account ? (<div>Connected to {account}</div>) :(<button onClick={async () => {await enableWeb3()}}>Connect</button>)} saying => if account exists then show this
and if not then connect with metamask.

Here 'components' is a directory where we create header and use those headers in 'pages' directory's js files.

we cant call await function in useEffect()*********

{} this curly braces allows us to do javascript in html file.

How do we get all of this:
const{runContractFunction: enterRaffle} = useWeb3Contract({
        abi:,
        contractAddress:,
        functionName:,
        params:{},
        msgValue:
    })
 =>   Create a folder named constants and create such files: abi.json, contractAddress.json
 
 1. create a updateFrontEnd.js script in deploy folder of our backend project root.
 2.
